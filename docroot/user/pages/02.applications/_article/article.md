        <h2>Risk-free conditional payments</h2>
        <p>
            Obyte allows you to do something that traditional currencies can't: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/obyte/making-p2p-great-again-fe9e20546a4a">conditional payments</a>.
            You set a condition when the payee receives the money. If the condition is not met, you get your money back.
        </p>
       <p>For example, you want to exchange 100 A-tokens for 10 B-tokens. You send 100 A-tokens to the peer and set a condition "the peer can receive A-tokens only once I receive 10 B-tokens". The A-tokens are temporarily locked on a smart contract that exists between you and the peer, and the peer can't take A-tokens before he fulfils his part of the deal. He sends B-tokens to you, then he is able to unlock A-tokens from the contract.</p>

        <h2>P2P insurance</h2>
        <p>You can hedge against negative events if you find a peer who is willing to bet on the event not happening.</p>
        <p>Insurance is just a simple smart contract that can be unlocked by the insured — if the event in question did occur, or by the insurer — otherwise.</p>
        <p>Creating a contract is available in Obyte wallet, no programming skills are required. Chat with the peer, click his address in chat, select "offer a contract", and fill a form. This is what human-readable/human-writable smart contract looks like. The peer will be able to view the contract and accept it with one click.</p>
        <p>If you want to buy flight delay insurance from a bot, find the corresponding bot in the Bot Store in the wallet and the bot will guide you through the process of smart contract creation.</p>

        <h2>Prediction markets</h2>
        <p>Make money by correctly predicting future events, or by providing liquidity to markets on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://prophet.ooo">Prophet</a>.</p>
        <p>Sports betting, binary options, and other bets on future events are available. You buy tokens that represent specific outcomes from a bonding curve that automatically prices the tokens depending on demand. If that outcome wins, you make money. You are free to sell your tokens back to the bonding curve at any time before the event.</p>
        <p>By buying all tokens that represet all the possible outcomes, you are providing liquidity and earn from the fees paid by other traders.</p>
